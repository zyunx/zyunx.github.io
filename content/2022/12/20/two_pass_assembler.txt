WHAT IS A SINGLE PASS ASSEMBLER?
It is an assembler that generally generates the object code directly in memory for immediate execution. 
It parses through your source code only once and you are done. 

Now let us see how a two pass assembler works. Simple, while on its way, if the assembler encounters 
an undefined label, it puts it into a symbol table along with the address where the undefined symbolâ€™s value 
has to be placed when the symbol is found in future
