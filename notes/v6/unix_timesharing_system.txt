3. The File System

3.1 Ordinary files

3.2 Directories
    Directories provide the mapping between the names of files and the files 
    themselves, and thus induce a structure on the file system as a whole.
    A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it cannot be
    written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system controls the contents 
    of directories.

3.3 Special files
    block and char files

3.4 Removable file systems
    mount, mkfs

3.5 Projection
    rwx and s(set user id)
    The set-user-ID feature provides for privileged programs which may use 
    files inaccessible to other users.
